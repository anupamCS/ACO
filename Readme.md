## Ant Colony Optimization

Ant colonies are distributed systems that in spite of their
simplicity represent a highly structured social organization. Based on their
behaviour, a metaheuristic Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) have been
developed in which a colony of artificial ants combines an adaptive
memory with a local heuristic function to repeatedly construct solutions
of hard combinatorial optimization problems.

Combinatorial Optimization problems are intriguing because
they are often easy to state but very difficult to solve; amounting huge
computational time applying brute-force technique. Travelling Salesman
Problem (TSP) is one of many Combinatorial Optimization Problems.
My work mainly focused on implementation of ACO in TSP which is a
NP Hard problem is done and presented in both console output using
Object Oriented Techniques and Methodologies with a focus of
optimizing the solution.
